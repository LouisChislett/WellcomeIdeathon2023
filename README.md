This is a copy of the submission of the "Social Scientists" team submission to the Wellcome Ideathon 2023. The majority of this code consists of a pipeline for building an app which allows for analysis of the sentiments and content of tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, making heavy use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in python and R. In order to view the app, simply run the [Shiny App](https://pages.github.com/).
